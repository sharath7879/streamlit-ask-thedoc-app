To create this ask the doc app, using Streamlit and Langchain, need below pre-requisites and libraries. This repo has all the necessary files to create the end-to-end app, including the DockerFile to build the Docker container.

First, we need the LLM model, in this case, I am using, the llama2 model, but you can replace it with any model of your choice.

The libraries used to develop this app are listed in the requirements.txt file
         langchain
         langchain_community
         ctransformers
         streamlit
         chromadb
